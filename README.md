## Description

As coding students, sleep is always on our mind because our studies mean that we often don't get enough! And we know that it affects our physical and mental health, and our ability to focus on our coursework. So, we made this tracker and quiz that keeps record of your sleep and provides a visual display to help you identify sleep habits and trends.

* Run $ git clone https://github.com/hollywilkalis/pocket-cheerleader.git
* Navigate into the project directory: $ cd pocket-cheerleader
* Run $ npm install

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

## Running unit tests
### Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests
## Known Bugs

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
* Currently the Firebase data server only stores one user record at a time.
* On the sleep quiz, checking a checkbox input twice (to uncheck) will treat it as two positives.
* Currently the charts are only coded to respond to data for January and February.
